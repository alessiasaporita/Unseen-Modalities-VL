Our method is trained
with 120 epochs on video classification with a learning rate of 10−4, reduced to 10−5 for the last 50
epochs. On robot state regression and multimedia retrieval, we train our method with 50 epochs and
a learning rate of 10−2.
For robot state regression and multimedia retrieval, e=20. For the overall
training objective (Eq. 3), we set α=3000 for video classification, while α=1 for regression and
retrieval. λ=0.001 is used for all the three tasks
